# ChatBot
Chatbot to demonstrate simple machine learning techniques such as natural language processing, tokenization and deep neural network. 

## Steps:

1. Run the train_chatboy.py file
  - This step will read the intents.json file and pre-process the data with tokenization and lemmatization. It will also create a 3-layer neural network which will be trained with the intents-data. 

2. Start the chatgui.py file.
   - This step will start a simple interactive chatbot which will give a random reply based on the intent-identification from the neural network.
